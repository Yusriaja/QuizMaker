 * Created by omar on 01.12.16.
 * This class is messed up.
 * I wanted to build an array of answers based on the constructor variable yesOrNo and then pass it to the super constructor.
 * Because of Java wanting me to call the super function first in the constructor I had to play around it with the static method and a second constructor.
